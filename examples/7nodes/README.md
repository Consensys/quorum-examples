# 7nodes
## Set Up
Start the 7nodes sample network by following the instructions in [the quorum-examples README](../../README.md).

## Demonstrating Privacy
The 7nodes example comes with some simple contracts to demonstrate the privacy features of Quorum.  In this demo we will:
- Send a private transaction between nodes 1 and 7
- Show that only nodes 1 and 7 are able to view the initial state of the contract
- Have Node 1 update the state of the contract and, once the block containing the updated transaction is validated by the network, again verify that only nodes 1 and 7 are able to see the updated state of the contract 

> [Constellation](https://github.com/Consensys/constellation) or [Tessera](https://github.com/Consensys/tessera) is used to enable the privacy features of Quorum.  To start a Quorum node without its associated privacy transaction manager, set `PRIVATE_CONFIG=ignore` when starting the node.

### Sending a private transaction

Send an example private contract from Node 1 to Node 7 (this is denoted by Node 7's public key passed via `privateFor: ["ROAZBWtSacxXQrOe3FGAqJDyJjFePR5ce4TSIzmJ0Bc="]` in `private-contract.js`):
```sh
./runscript.sh private-contract.js
```
Make note of the `TransactionHash` printed to the terminal.

### Inspecting the Quorum nodes

We can inspect any of the Quorum nodes by using `geth attach` to open the Geth JavaScript console.  For this demo, we will be inspecting Node 1, Node 4 and Node 7.  

It is recommended to use separate terminal windows for each node we are inspecting.  In each terminal, ensure you are in the `path/to/7nodes` directory, then:

- In terminal 1 run `geth attach ipc:qdata/dd1/geth.ipc` to attach to node 1
- In terminal 2 run `geth attach ipc:qdata/dd4/geth.ipc` to attach to node 4
- In terminal 3 run `geth attach ipc:qdata/dd7/geth.ipc` to attach to node 7

To look at the private transaction that was just sent, run the following command in one of the terminals:
```sh
eth.getTransaction("0xe28912c5694a1b8c4944b2252d5af21724e9f9095daab47bac37b1db0340e0bf")
```
where you should replace this hash with the TransactionHash that was previously printed to the terminal.  This will print something of the form:
```sh
{
  blockHash: "0x4d6eb0d0f971b5e0394a49e36ba660c69e62a588323a873bb38610f7b9690b34",
  blockNumber: 1,
  from: "0xed9d02e382b34818e88b88a309c7fe71e65f419d",
  gas: 4700000,
  gasPrice: 0,
  hash: "0xe28912c5694a1b8c4944b2252d5af21724e9f9095daab47bac37b1db0340e0bf",
  input: "0x58c0c680ee0b55673e3127eb26e5e537c973cd97c70ec224ccca586cc4d31ae042d2c55704b881d26ca013f15ade30df2dd196da44368b4a7abfec4a2022ec6f",
  nonce: 0,
  r: "0x4952fd6cd1350c283e9abea95a2377ce24a4540abbbf46b2d7a542be6ed7cce5",
  s: "0x4596f7afe2bd23135fa373399790f2d981a9bb8b06144c91f339be1c31ec5aeb",
  to: null,
  transactionIndex: 0,
  v: "0x25",
  value: 0
}
```

Note the `v` field value of `"0x25"` or `"0x26"` (37 or 38 in decimal) which indicates this transaction has a private payload (input). 


#### Checking the state of the contract
For each of the 3 nodes we'll use the Geth JavaScript console to create a variable called `address` which we will assign to the address of the contract created by Node 1.  The contract address can be found in two ways:  

- In Node 1's log file: `7nodes/qdata/logs/1.log`
- By reading the `contractAddress` param after calling `eth.getTransactionReceipt(txHash)` ([Ethereum API documentation](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethgettransactionreceipt)) where `txHash` is the hash printed to the terminal after sending the transaction.

Once you've identified the contract address, run the following command in each terminal:
```
> var address = "0x1932c48b2bf8102ba33b4a6b545c32236e342f34"; //replace with your contract address 
``` 

Next we'll use ```eth.contract``` to define a contract class with the simpleStorage ABI definition in each terminal:
```
> var abi = [{"constant":true,"inputs":[],"name":"storedData","outputs":[{"name":"","type":"uint256"}],"payable":false,"type":"function"},{"constant":false,"inputs":[{"name":"x","type":"uint256"}],"name":"set","outputs":[],"payable":false,"type":"function"},{"constant":true,"inputs":[],"name":"get","outputs":[{"name":"retVal","type":"uint256"}],"payable":false,"type":"function"},{"inputs":[{"name":"initVal","type":"uint256"}],"type":"constructor"}];
> var private = eth.contract(abi).at(address)
```

The function calls are now available on the contract instance and you can call those methods on the contract. Let's start by examining the initial value of the contract to make sure that only nodes 1 and 7 can see the initialized value.
- In terminal window 1 (Node 1):
```
> private.get()
42
```
- In terminal window 2 (Node 4):
```
> private.get()
0
```
- In terminal window 3 (Node 7):
```
> private.get()
42
```

So we can see nodes 1 and 7 are able to read the state of the private contract and its initial value is 42.  If you look in `private-contract.js` you will see that this was the value set when the contract was created.  Node 4 is unable to read the state. 

### Updating the state of the contract

Next we'll have Node 1 set the state to the value `4` and verify only nodes 1 and 7 are able to view the new state.

In terminal window 1 (Node 1):
```
> private.set(4,{from:eth.accounts[0],privateFor:["ROAZBWtSacxXQrOe3FGAqJDyJjFePR5ce4TSIzmJ0Bc="]});
"0xacf293b491cccd1b99d0cfb08464a68791cc7b5bc14a9b6e4ff44b46889a8f70"
```
You can check the log files in `7nodes/qdata/logs/` to see each node validating the block with this new private transaction. Once the block containing the transaction has been validated we can once again check the state from each node 1, 4, and 7.
- In terminal window 1 (Node 1):
```
> private.get()
4
```
- In terminal window 2 (Node 4):
```
> private.get()
0
```
- In terminal window 3 (Node 7):
```
> private.get()
4
```
And there you have it: All 7 nodes are validating the same blockchain of transactions, with the private transactions containing only a 512 bit hash in place of the transaction data, and only the parties to the private transactions being able to view and update the state of the private contracts.

### Private Transactions with Privacy Enhancements

#### Set up 

Before running the relevant initialization script make sure to define the `PRIVACY_ENHANCEMENTS=true` environment variable. The init script will then update the `genesis.json` to enable privacy enhancements from block 0 (`privacyEnhancementsBlock: 0`).

```
export PRIVACY_ENHANCEMENTS=true
```

#### Usage

Add the relevant `privacyFlag` to your private transaction parameters:
* 0 - Standard Private (optional - when omitted the `privacyFlag` is assumed to be standard private)
* 1 - Party Protection (PP)
* 2 - Mandatory Recipients (MR)
* 3 - Private State Validation (PSV)

Party Protection, Mandatory Recipient, and Private State Validation versions of the `private-contract.js` (`private-contract-pp.js`, `private-contract-mr.js` and `private-contract-psv.js`) have been prepared that deploy the simple storage contract `privateFor` Node2 from Node 1.

Similar to the standard private example above you can update a PP, MR or PSV contract by specifying the appropriate `privacyFlag`.  
```shell
private.set(6, {from:web3.eth.accounts[0], gas: 0x47b760, privacyFlag:1, privateFor: ["BULeR8JyUWhiuuCMU/HLA0Q5pzkYT+cHII3ZKBey3Bo="]})
```
For further details about [privacy enhancements](https://docs.goquorum.consensys.net/en/latest/Concepts/Privacy/PrivacyEnhancements/) please consult the latest go-quorum documentation.  

### Private Transactions using Privacy Marker Transactions

#### Set up

Before running the relevant startup script, set the `QUORUM_GETH_ARGS` environment variable with the command line argument to enable the creation of privacy marker transactions.
The `genesis.json` is already set up to support processing of privacy marker transactions from block 0 (`privacyPrecompileBlock: 0`).

```
export QUORUM_GETH_ARGS="--privacymarker.enable"
```

#### Usage

Submit private transactions to the network as normal, for example using the `geth` console:
```shell
> loadScript('private-contract.js')
Contract transaction send: TransactionHash: 0xdeb7058fe871b11fb544eadeeafb62de44e035fb57587d550e39f925ab87c86b waiting to be mined...
undefined
> Contract mined! Address: 0x180893a0ec847fa8c92786791348d7d65916acbb
```

This will return the transaction hash for the public Privacy Marker Transaction. The receipt for this can be retrieved as normal using `eth_getTransactionReceipt()`.

In order to retrieve details of the underlying private transaction, you must use the functions `eth_getPrivateTransaction()` and `eth_getPrivateTransactionReceipt()`. These are only available to participants of the private transaction. Non-participants will receive an empty result.

For further details about [privacy marker transactions](https://docs.goquorum.consensys.net/en/latest/Concepts/Privacy/PrivacyMarkerTransactions/) please consult the latest go-quorum documentation.

## Permissions

Node Permissioning is a feature in Quorum that allows only a pre-defined set of nodes (as identified by their remotekey/enodes) to connect to the permissioned network.

In this demo we will:
- Set up a network with a combination of permissioned and non-permissioned nodes in the cluster
- Look at the details of the `permissioned-nodes.json` file
- Demonstrate that only the nodes that are specified in `permissioned-nodes.json` can connect to the network

### Verify only permissioned nodes are connected to the network.

Attach to the individual nodes via `geth attach path/to/geth.ipc` and use `admin.peers` to check the connected nodes:

```
‚ùØ geth attach qdata/dd1/geth.ipc
Welcome to the Geth JavaScript console!

instance: Geth/v1.7.2-stable/darwin-amd64/go1.9.2
coinbase: 0xed9d02e382b34818e88b88a309c7fe71e65f419d

    name: "Geth/v1.7.2-stable/darwin-amd64/go1.9.2",
    network: {
      localAddress: "127.0.0.1:65188",
      remoteAddress: "127.0.0.1:21001"
    },
    protocols: {
      eth: {
        difficulty: 0,
        head: "0xc23b4ebccc79e2636d66939924d46e618269ca1beac5cf1ec83cc862b88b1b71",
        version: 63
      }
    }
},
...
]
```

You can also inspect the log files under `qdata/logs/*.log` for further diagnostics messages around incoming / outgoing connection requests. `grep` for `ALLOWED-BY` or `DENIED-BY`. Be sure to enable verbosity for p2p module.

### Permissioning configuration

Permissioning is granted based on the remote key of the geth node. The remote keys are specified in the `permissioned-nodes.json` and is placed under individual node's `<datadir>`.

The below sample `permissioned-nodes.json` provides a list of nodes permissioned to join the network (node ids truncated for clarity):

```
[
   "enode://8475a01f22a1f48116dc1f0d22ecaaaf77e@127.0.0.1:30301",
   "enode://b5660501f496e60e59ded734a889c97b7da@127.0.0.1:30302",
   "enode://54bd7ff4bd971fb80493cf4706455395917@127.0.0.1:30303"
]
```

### Enabling/Disabling permissions

An individual node can enable/disable permissioning by passing the `-permissioned` command line flag. If enabled, then only the nodes that are in the `<datadir>/permissioned-nodes.json` can connect to it. Further, these are the only nodes that this node can make outbound connections to as well.

```
MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS:
--permissioned          If enabled, the node will allow only a defined list of nodes to connect
```

## Next steps
Additional samples can be found in `quorum-examples/examples/7nodes/samples` for you to use and edit.  You can also create your own contracts to help you understand how the nodes in a Quorum network work together.

Check out some of the other examples highlighting and showcasing the functionality offered by the Quorum platform.  An up-to-date list can be found in the [Quorum Documentation](https://docs.goquorum.com/en/latest/Getting%20Started/Quorum-Examples/) site.

## Adding Cakeshop

[Cakeshop](https://github.com/Consensys/cakeshop) is our Monitoring and Development dashboard for Quorum networks. It allows to you see the current status of the network and inspect transactions, as well as compile and deploy solidity contracts. To run an instance of Cakeshop alongside of the 7nodes example, run `./cakeshop-start.sh` and then go to http://localhost:8999 in your browser to see the UI.
